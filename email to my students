“Keep a Diary”

The next few weeks are going to be something that you will remember for the rest of your lives.
There will be a time in the years to come when your children and grandchildren will ask you questions. 

It may be important that you take some time to share your thoughts by writing them down. Clip some newspaper articles.
Record some videos. Draw, paint and sketch. 

You can look back at the memories in 10, 20 and more years from now. I’m certain that you will look back and
understand things differently than today. It’s a great advantage of age and experience. 

When I was 17 it was the time of Iranian hostages, Ronald Reagan and AIDS. Those events influenced how I grew up. 

The Covid 19 virus is probably going to be a big deal for us and the world. I know that each of you will
do great things in life. I’m sure that lots of things are going to be crazy today but hopefully better tomorrow. 

I hope that you can relax and enjoy your time away from our class. 

Best

NP
