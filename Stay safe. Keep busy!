First, I hope that you and all those who matter to you are safe and remain healthy. 

I intend to use my time to get some Cybersecurity certification courses done. 

If you are looking for something to learn, perhaps you should try the C programming language. Hereâ€™s a free resource to get you started.

I would certainly be happy to help with this effort or direct you to other resources. 

Read a book. Call a relative. Try a new hobby. Make sure that you make your time away from school useful!

See you soon!
