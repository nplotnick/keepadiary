My letter to students during the Covid 19 sequestering
On Thursday March 12, we left work and discovered that evening that school was being cancelled for 6 weeks.
This repository has my original message to my students and some of the aftermath.

I hope that my #KeepADiary hashtag goes viral and gives students and others an opportunity to catalog their thoughts and observations about this incredible period of our history.
